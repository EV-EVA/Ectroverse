So, what is Ectroverse?</i></b></a><br>Ectroverse is a game created by
Maloeran. Here you will find his words for describing the game: "Briefly,
Ectroverse is a massive multiplayer game, where players compete for
dominance over the galaxy resources. I'm aware several similar online games
exist, and I played some myself for a long time. Thinking I could do much
better, I started writing EV, and I hope I succeded ;). I'm working on it in
my spare time since several months, along with a few other projects in the
open source community."<br>Maloeran hasn't done any work on Ectroverse for
many years. It was picked up again by various number of people. This version
is heavily modified (rewritten) by Helliens.<br><br><a name="a1"><b><i>1.
Who is in the current team?</i></b></a><br><a
href="mailto:eva@ectroverse.org">EVA</a>, administrator<br>
<br><a
name="a3"><b><i>2. What language was Ectroverse written
in?</i></b></a><br>Ectroverse is a server program itself, listening to the
port, handling http requests, with its own database. It was written in C for
Linux, but could easily compile on other UNIX platforms with a few minor
modifications ( for those who are still not sure, no, it doesn't compile or
run on windows ).<br><br><a name="a4"><b><i>3. Why did you not use
perl/php/jsp/etc.?</i></b></a><br>The main reason would be that a single
threaded game server program listening to the port is a thousand times more
efficient. Another reason is that I am a programmer and not a scripter ;),
it seemed an interesting challenge anyway.<br><br><a name="a5"><b><i>4.
Fine, where's the source code?</i></b></a><br><a
href="https://github.com/ectroverse/evsource">Here</a> is the current code.<br>I want to warn any potential source reader : there is no
comments or documentation, and some parts of the code are especially messy.
Good luck :)<br><br><a name="a6"><b><i>5. Can I run my own
galaxy?</i></b></a><br>Sure, all you need comes with the source. On the
other hand... all this is not documented in any way. So good luck.<br><br><a
name="a7"><b><i>6. What are the requirements for running a galaxy or a
modified version of EV?</i></b></a><br>The hardware requirements? Low, very
low. As an example, a 80486 and 50mb of hard disk should be enough for a 300
players galaxy. A decent speed internet connection, a static IP and any Unix
based operating system would also be
required.<br></td></tr></table><br><br><table width="100%" border="0"

rules?</i></b></a><br>At the moment, there is only a very small set of
rules, just to make sure the game is enjoyable for everybody.<br>- Owning
more than one account or logging in other empires than yours is not allowed.
On the other hand, a player leaving the game can give his account to someone
else not actually playing.<br>- Harassing players is not tolerated, in
forums or through in-game messages, this includes cuss words in any
language.<br>- Language used in the game and family pictures must not be of
a discriminatory, racist, sexist or sexual nature.<br>- Any bugs encountered
must be reported, and not abused.<br>Players breaking the rules will get a
warning, an account deletion or a permanent ban. Rules are subject to
change.<br></td></tr></table><br><br><table width="100%" border="0"

name="c0"><b><i>0. How come the feature xyz is not yet implemented? When
will it be?</i></b></a><br>There are several new features planned for
Ectroverse which have not been implemented, yet.<br>A time of delivery
cannot be given.<br><br><a name="c1"><b><i>1. Why can't we have customizable
races?</i></b></a><br>In my opinion, races should exist to encourage
teamwork between family members, as working with other players surely make
the game more interesting. Though, I really don't want over-specialized
races, as all custom ones would be ; these would force players to adopt a
very specific way of playing without being able to change their role during
the round, any non-specialized race would then also be non-optimal ( and
therefore, never used ). New players who didn't make a such "perfect" race
would also be penalized the whole round.<br><br><a name="c2"><b><i>2. Why
are empires not ranked by Networth instead of planets
count?</i></b></a><br>Networth rankings would encourage players to stockpile
and attempt to reach the higher networth as possible for the end of the
round, which is somewhat uninteresting. On the other hand, rankings based on
planet counts tend to generate some large wars before the end of the round
as families try to gather as many planets as
possible.<br><br></td></tr></table><br><br><table width="100%" border="0"

problem related to Ectroverse, but to the browser you are using. It occurs
only with Internet Explorer ( or the AOL thing ), the program decides to
stop requesting up-to-date pages from the server and display previously
cached ones instead. A known solution, I heard, is to delete the cache
files. Another solution would be to upgrade your browser to <a
href="http://www.mozilla.org/" target="_blank">Mozilla</a> or <a
href="http://www.opera.com/" target="_blank">Opera</a>. It could also
be caused by a bad proxy, ignoring http headers and caching
files.<br></td></tr></table><br><br><table width="100%" border="0"
