<br>The project is to make an open source internet game as a single-threaded server program written in pure ansi-C<br>To contact us : <a href="mailto:alexisn@colba.net">Maloeran</a>, <a href="mailto:dzyu@gmx.net">Daz</a>, <a href="mailto:tailchaser@deus.yi.org">Tailchaser</a><br><table width="90%"><tr><td width="65%"><b>News</b><br><br><i>12 december</i><br>The server program was just updated, changes are :<br>- Players can generate maps displaying other empires planets, using the Map generation link or from the players page ( heard of icmap? :) )<br>- Buildings in construction and units stationned appear on the planets page<br>- An "irregularity" in the battle algorithm was fixed ( thanks Mortis )<br>I just converted the current database to the new format... assuming I didn't forget anything, it won't cause problems.<br><br><i>9 december, later</i><br>As it seems 5 minutes ticks are slightly too slow to really test attacking, I just reduced them to 2 minutes.<br><br><i>9 december</i><br>It has been a while since the last update, but several improvements were required to make attacks possible. What was added :<br>- News system<br>- Fleets movements, station, recall<br>- Portals, portals coverage<br>- Raze buildings<br>- Disband units<br>- Attacks<br>- Another IE compatibility problems fixed<br>The battles code was not abundantly tested yet, encountering problems is not impossible ( although unlikely ). Tailchaser has a first version of forums working, but we'll still be using the <a href="http://www.icwizards.net/modules.php?name=Forums&file=viewforum&f=18">icwizards forums</a> for the moment..<br><br>Hopefully, this will be the last "pre-alpha" round, the next one should have all the most important features ( forums, in game messaging, completed famlies code, completed research, market, spells, operations, etc. ).<br><br>Ticks are set for 5 minutes each, you can attack anyone above 33% of your NW ( FR, or other similar mechanisms, are not yet implemented ), and building of exploration ships is still unlimited. It is actually possible to completely destroy players fleet... In the next version, fleeing from battles will be possible to avoid being annhilated when opponents forces are too strong.<br><br>As always, fee free to share your comments, suggestions, new ideas ( and bugs report ) in the <a href="http://www.icwizards.net/modules.php?name=Forums&file=viewforum&f=18">forum</a>.<br><a href="prealpha2.html">Pre-alpha 2 unsorted rankings</a><br><br><i>2 december, later<br></i>Small note : I could keep updating the program for the next days... If it doesn't work, doesn't respond or you get a "logged out" message, it's because I'm recompiling it :).<br>Research centers now do produce research, 10 points a tick each.<br><br><i>2 december</i><br>I want to thank everybody who participated in this "pre-alpha" test, and for all the interesting ideas and suggestions received! Feel free to discuss the project on <a href="http://www.icwizards.net">icwizards.net</a> forums, <a href="http://www.icwizards.net/modules.php?name=Forums&file=viewforum&f=18">Game discussion section</a>.<br><br>As it seems you all managed to explore every single planet in the galaxy, I think it marks the end of this little test round ( slowing down the building of exploration ships seems required! ).<br><br>In case anyone is interested, you can see unsorted rankings <a href="prealpha1.html">here</a>. A special award goes to Spooky3do, who managed to find the first bug of the game! :)<br><br>No new code was written these last two days, as I was gathering ideas and suggestions around before continuing, but the bug that prevented some users to log in is fixed ( it seems a very specific version of Internet Explorer isn't perfectly compliant to http 1.1 standards, but finding a work around was not a problem ).<br><br>I will still let this first version of the game run, just in case people would want to see what it looks like. For the next version, being able to attack will be the main improvement, as soon as we can decide how battles should work exactly. Vens posted some interesting ideas in the icwizards forum, if you want to comment or make suggestions on your own.</td><td width="25%" align="center" valign="top"><h2><a href="register"><b>Register</b></a></h2><br><br><h2><a href="login" target="_top"><b>Log in</b></a></h2></td></tr></table><br><br></center>
